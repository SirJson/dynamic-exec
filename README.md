# DynamicExec

This fork of SimpleExec that exists as as a) proof of concept for dynamic os execute and b) if such package could be consumed by dotnet-script.

It's foundation is the original SimpleExec code by Adam Ralph but very simplified and async only. Another goal was to have the ability to cancel a process if needed.

## Usage

This is unproven work and WIP. I may not even know myself yet if it works!
